# SWE Math Weekly

This is a repository my solutions to the weekly math problems I solve for the [SWE Math Weekly](https://arpitbhayani.me/math) challenge from Arpit Bhayani.

All solutions are written in Python using [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) and contain inline markdown cells and latex equations to explain the solutions.
