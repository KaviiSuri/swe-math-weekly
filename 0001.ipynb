    "In the mysterious Grand Library of Alexandria (which secretly still exists!), historians discovered an ancient library containing some sacred knowledge in the form of books. The books were so holy that each one was kept in a vault and each unique vault was locked by a unique pattern, an n-dimensional vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "Young apprentice librarian Maya found a set of keys lying on the floor along with a scroll. The scroll contained a spell that could work on a set of keys and generate all possible keys to open all possible vaults of the library. The spell combines the keys in a linear way.\n",
    "\n",
    "Help Maya find if the set of keys she found is sufficient enough and also fewest possible to generate all possible keys and unlock all the vaults of the library. Help Maya write a program that checks this.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: Since the ancient mechanism works with real numbers, your solution should handle floating-point arithmetic carefully."

    "The problem is to check if the set of keys can generate all possible keys. In mathematical terms, we need to check if the set of keys are basis vectors of the $n$ dimensional vector space.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What are Basis Vectors?\n",
    "\n",
    "Basis vectors are a set of vectors that can be linearly combined to generate all possible vectors in the vector space. For example, in 2D space, the basis vectors are $(1, 0)$ and $(0, 1)$. Any vector in 2D space can be generated by multiplying these basis vectors by some scalars and adding them together.\n",
    "\n",
    "**For an $n$ dimensional vector space, we need $n$ basis vectors to form a basis**. (3 for 3d space, 2 for 2d space, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "To be basis vectors, the set of vectors must be **linearly independent** and span the entire vector space.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How to check if a set of vectors are linearly independent?\n",
    "\n",
    "A set of vectors ${v_1, v_2, ..., v_n}$ are linearly independent if the only solution to the equation $c_1v_1 + c_2v_2 + ... + c_nv_n = 0$ is $c_1 = c_2 = ... = c_n = 0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Modeling this in matrix form, we can write the equation as:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{bmatrix}\n",
    "v_1 & v_2 & ... & v_n\n",
    "\\end{bmatrix}\n",
    "\\begin{bmatrix}\n",
    "c_1 \\\\\n",
    "c_2 \\\\\n",
    "... \\\\\n",
    "c_n\n",
    "\\end{bmatrix} = 0\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $A$ be the matrix formed by the vectors $v_1, v_2, ..., v_n$. Then, we can write the equation as:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "A \\mathbf{c} = 0\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, given that $A$ is always a square matrix in this problem (since we are given $n$ vectors in $n$ dimensions). We just need to check if $A^{-1}$ exists, since if it does, then the only solution to the equation $A \\mathbf{c} = 0$ is $\\mathbf{c} = 0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How to check if $A^{-1}$ exists?\n",
    "\n",
    "$A^{-1}$ exists if and only if the determinant of $A$ is not zero.\n",
